    <h3 class="under-title">Diary of a Tech-Savvy Teen: Learning HTML and Sharing Life Experiences.</h5>
    <p class="descript">    

        I'm Adelina, a 16-year-old teenager with an endless passion for technology and a burning desire to learn new things. And I want to share every moment of this journey with you!
        
        So, how did it all begin? Well, you might think that starting this blog to learn HTML might seem a bit strange, but let me explain. For some time now, I've been obsessed with the idea of understanding how websites work and how I can create one myself. With the support of a course called "The Girls Code: Breaking Barriers" by the ADFABER team, I managed to pave my way to HTML.
        
        But it's not just about HTML here. I want this space to be a place where we can connect and share experiences. So, alongside my journey into the world of technology, I'll also share fragments of my everyday life. From my passions and hobbies to my thoughts and feelings, everything will be on the table.
        
        So, if you're curious to learn more about HTML or if you just want to connect with a community of people who you can relate to, I invite you to join this journey. Let's learn and grow together, discover new horizons, and share the joys and challenges of life.
        
        So let's start this adventure together! I look forward to getting to know you and exploring the wonders of technology and life together!</p>

    <p class="descript">I'm a teenager with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and adventure, and my portfolio reflects this diversity.

        First of all, let's talk about my knowledge in the field of technology. Although I'm just at the beginning of my journey, I already have a solid foundation in HTML. I enjoy experimenting and creating my own web pages, and every line of code I write is a new discovery.
        
        In addition to my passion for technology, I am dedicated to studying computer science. I participate in Olympiads for C++ and passionately immerse myself in this fascinating world of algorithms and programming. Every competition is a challenge and an opportunity for me to learn and grow.
        
        But my talent doesn't stop there. I love to get involved in entrepreneurship competitions, where I can put my imagination and creativity to work. I enjoy coming up with innovative ideas and building projects that bring value to my community.
        
        Furthermore, my passion for art guides me in drawing competitions, where I put my imagination and talent to work to create works that reflect my vision of the world and convey emotion and beauty.
        
        And if that wasn't enough, I managed to obtain the Cambridge certification at B2 level in English. Studying the English language is a way for me to explore new cultures and connect with people from around the world.
        
        Last but not least, volunteering holds an important place in my life. I enthusiastically engage in various volunteering activities, where I can contribute to positive change in my community and use my skills to help those around me.
        
        This is my portfolio - a combination of passions, skills, and experiences that define me and motivate me to constantly grow and explore new horizons. I hope you find inspiration in my story, and together we can build a bright future full of achievements! </p>

    <p class="descript">Hello, my dear readers! I'm Adelina, and I'm thrilled to take you on a journey through my world of passions. I'm a teenager who lives to explore and discover beauty from every corner of life, and my passions are the pillars upon which I build my inner universe.

        Drawing and painting are like oxygen to me - essential for my existence. Every line drawn and every shade of color brings life to the blank canvas and helps me express what I feel in a unique and personal way. I love to lose myself in the world of creativity and discover new ways to bring imagination to life.
        
        History and historical films fascinate and inspire me in unexpected ways. I love to explore stories from the past and understand how they have influenced present-day events. Each historical film is a journey through time and space, and I am always captivated by the story they tell.
        
        Philosophy is another passion that makes me reflect on the world and my place in it. I love to explore profound questions about existence, morality, and the meaning of life, and to try to find answers that help me better understand the surrounding world.
        
        Reading is a pleasure I cannot describe in words. I love to lose myself in the pages of books and travel to imaginary worlds, meet fascinating characters, and explore new and challenging ideas.
        
        Music is the soundtrack of my life. Regardless of my mood, I always find comfort and inspiration in the melodious notes and profound lyrics. I listen to various musical genres and love to discover new and talented artists.
        
        And, of course, technology is an integral part of my modern life. I love to explore the latest technological innovations and discover new ways to use technology to improve life and bring positive change to the world.
        
        So, these are the passions that define me and inspire me every day. I hope you've enjoyed getting to know a little more about me and my inner universe. I invite you to journey together through the world of passions and discover the beauty and inspiration from every corner of life! </p>

    <p class="descript">I discover a new part of the world and myself, and each experience inspires and changes me in wonderful ways.

        While I often find myself seeking exotic and distant destinations, my love for Romania, my homeland, remains boundless. I love to explore every corner of this country full of history and natural beauty. The medieval castles, with their enchanting stories and impressive architecture, are among my favorite places. Each visit to a castle is like a journey through time, and each stone holds secrets centuries old.
        
        But despite my love for Romania, my heart also turns to Greece. I fondly remember my trips to Thassos, Paralia Katerini, Skala Potamia, and Skiathos, where I was immersed in the shimmering blue of the sea and wandered among picturesque streets and sunny beaches. Each island and each city was an adventure in itself, full of dreamy landscapes and memorable experiences.
        
        So, join me on this extraordinary journey through the world! Together, we'll discover the beauty and diversity of our world and create unforgettable memories along the way. Let's embark on this journey and explore together what the world has to offer! </p>
